Let the Summer begin!

This repo houses the random scripts and C snippet codes I write in order to carry out random tasks. 
This also houses my CSF111 course Lab work submissions, along with the lab sheets.

TODO:
1. Streamline the scripts.
2. Clear clutter.
3. Categorize them.
4. Work more on awesome stuff this Summer!
